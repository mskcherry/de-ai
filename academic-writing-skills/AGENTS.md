# Repository Guidelines

## Project Structure & Module Organization
Core skill packages live under `academic-writing-skills/`, with one directory per skill such as `latex-paper-en/`, `latex-thesis-zh/`, `typst-paper/`, `bib-search-citation/`, and `paper-audit/`. Each skill typically contains `SKILL.md`, `scripts/`, `references/`, `examples/`, and optional `agents/` or `evals/`. Automated tests live in `tests/` and mirror script-level behavior. User-facing documentation is in `docs/` with localized content under `docs/zh/`. Use `ref/` for supporting reference material, not product code.

## Build, Test, and Development Commands
Use `uv` for Python workflows and `just` as the main task runner.

- `just install`: install runtime and dev dependencies with `uv sync --extra dev`.
- `just lint`: run `ruff format --check` and `ruff check`.
- `just typecheck`: run `pyright`.
- `just test`: run the pytest suite in `tests/`.
- `just ci`: run lint, type checks, and tests in sequence.
- `just docs`: start the VitePress docs site locally from `docs/`.
- `just doc-build`: build the static documentation site.

## Coding Style & Naming Conventions
Target Python 3.10+ and keep code compatible with the repository’s `pyright` and `ruff` settings. Follow Ruff’s 100-character line length and default formatter output; run `just fix` before opening a PR when needed. Use `snake_case` for Python modules, functions, and test files, and keep skill directories kebab-cased to match existing package names such as `latex-paper-en`. Prefer small script utilities in `scripts/` over embedding logic in `SKILL.md`.

## Testing Guidelines
Pytest is the test framework. Name files `test_*.py`, test functions `test_*`, and place shared fixtures in `tests/conftest.py`. Add or update tests whenever changing parsing, validation, or report-generation scripts. Run `just test` locally before submitting; use `just ci` for broader verification when touching multiple skills or docs tooling.

## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines
Recent history follows scoped Conventional Commit style, for example `docs: ...` or `refactor(latex-thesis-zh): ...`. Keep commits focused by skill or subsystem. PRs should include a short summary, affected paths, test evidence (`just test` or `just ci`), and screenshots for `docs/` UI changes. Link the relevant issue when one exists.

## Documentation & Contributor Notes
When adding a new skill, mirror the existing layout: `SKILL.md`, executable helpers in `scripts/`, concrete examples, and concise references. Keep docs synchronized with `README.md` and the VitePress pages when behavior changes.
